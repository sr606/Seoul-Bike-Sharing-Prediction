# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Prediction


## **Problem Description**

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.


## **Abstract:**

A bicycle-sharing system, bike share program, public bicycle scheme, or public bike share (PBS) scheme is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free.
Predicting bike-sharing demand can help bike-sharing companies to allocate bikes better and ensure sufficient circulation of bikes for customers.

1. Understanding the problem:
 We will analyze the given dataset and find meaningful assumptions regarding the significance of this problem.

2. EDA: 
While doing Exploratory Data Analysis, we will find meaningful information from the dataset.

3. Applying Models: 
We will use different regression models and find which model best fits our dataset to find the best prediction.

4. Feature Importance: 
We will also obtain which features will most likely affect the dependent variable (number of bikes rented) in each model.
